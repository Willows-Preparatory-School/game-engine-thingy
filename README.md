# game-engine
i was bored. <br>
so i wrote a game engine in opengl and LWJGL (lightweight java game library). <br>
this isn't finished, and it probably won't compile for you, for now at least. <br>
and yes im aware the ``lib/`` folder is a mess of .jar files, ill fix it soon, (maybe) <br>
### SCENE INFO: <br>
right now the scene is a few texture tests, and a cube. <br>
if you wanna move the camera around, hold right click to turn camera view, <br>
then use W A S and D to move the camera around. <br>
### HOW DO I RUN THIS MESS: <br>
if you (for some reason) want to run this engine, <br>
clone the github repo, then open it in intellij, <br>
then, there should be a run config i've already created so just run that and hope it works. ^w^ <br>
### ABOUT WORKING_DIRECTORY: <br>
the ``working_directory/`` folder is where all the game's assets and engine's shaders are held, <br>
when running the engine as a standalone ``.jar``, <br>
**make sure** to point it's working directory to that folder <br>
### Extra notes:
im not the best at java, so pull requests are welcome :3 <br>
oh and if you see commits from the account ``Spicy-Axolotl``, then that's my other account i use <br>
